# Professional README Generator

## Description
As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new Project.

This command-line application will dynamically generate a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

~~~
node index.js
~~~
